                                other types of currency. </p>

                                prices/offers in USD and does not change the price of the package due to exchange
                                fluctuation and we reserve the right to adjust pricing due to increase of cost that is
                                beyond our control. Any misconception of the pricing while you translate into your
                                currency does not give you the right to receive any refund nor withhold payments.</p>

                                bookings are subject to availability. Before any deposits are made, all services will be
                                booked and secured as per your detailed offer.</p>
                            <h3>Booking errors </h3>
                            <p>If any errors occur in your bookings then we are responsible for that whether it is a
                                fault made by our staff or our systems. We are not responsible for booking errors if
                                they occur due to lack of or misinformation from you. If the fault is due to
                                uncontrollable or unavoidable circumstances then we are not responsible for errors in
                                your bookings. </p>
                            <h3>Client changes of contract prior to arrival </h3>
                            <p>Any changes of services between the booking confirmation / depositing and the arrival of
                                the client, due to a request from the client, shall be arranged if possible and any
                                additional cost will be paid by the client before arrival. Requests for such changes
                                shall be made in writing by the person who made the booking and will be dealt with as
                                soon as possible. Results are subject to booking situations with suppliers and general
                                demand at the time of the change being made. If the changes are not possible and you
                                decide to cancel your services then our “cancellation by client” section applies. </p>
                            <h3>Client changes of contract during the trip</h3>
                            <p>Any changes requested by the client during the trip will be handled as soon as possible
                                and with regard to the request, booking situation and conditions at the time. All
                                requests shall be made in writing/email by the client. Any additional cost generated by
                                these ad hoc changes befalls the client. Excessive overtime that may be necessary due to
                                short notice changes, can be calculated into added cost among other elements. In such
                                cases Seasons Tour will only ask for an appropriate payment based on actual cost. </p>
                            <p>Seasons Tour is not liable to refund unused services, should the client choose not to do
                                some activities or tours during their trip that are included in the contract. </p>
                            <h3>Changes made by Seasons Tour prior to your arrival</h3>
                            <p>Seasons Tour reserves the right to make minor changes to your contract should any
                                circumstances demand that. We will notify you immediately and propose the best solution
                                or replacement available. </p>
                            <p>If significant changes to the outline of your itinerary are necessary due to
                                unforeseeable reasons we will notify you without delay. We may either offer you to move
                                your travel arrangements to a later date but if that is not possible on your end then we
                                can also offer you a substitute package that may be adjusted to possible dates. </p>
                            <p>Should that package be of lower quality or cost due for example to fewer days travelled
                                with us then we will adjust the pricing accordingly. If changes to your contract
                                constitute what is considered significant changes or constitute a significant
                                augmentation of cost (more than 8% increase of total cost) then you are also entitled to
                                choose to cancel your trip. </p>
                            <p>Should you use your right, due to significant changes, to terminate the contract with us
                                all together then you can do so without any penalties to the cost of your travel
                                package. Your refund for all travel arrangements will be made within 14 days from
                                notification of cancellation. </p>
                            <h3>Changes made by Seasons Tour during your trip</h3>
                            <p>The weather in Georgia changes very quickly and is the main reason why tours and
                                activities need to be moved or changed. Your guide will be constantly monitoring this
                                factor and will keep you informed should any changes need to be made for your safety or
                                experience due to either ongoing weather problems or if forecasts predict them. Your
                                guide in collaboration with the back office will then provide alternative options / Plan
                                B in order to keep the flow of your trip uninterrupted or propose new timing of that
                                activity/tour if possible. </p>
                            <p>Seasons Tour is highly concerned about our client’s safety and overall contentment and we
                                rely on our experts in each area to provide accurate and reliable information and
                                reserve the right to adjust tours or activities when deemed necessary. </p>
                            <p>In case of unavoidable and unforeseen events / force majeure Seasons Tour is not liable
                                for damages or amends. But we will do our very best to assist you in such cases.</p>
                            <h3>Health</h3>
                            <p>Seasons Tour can not be made responsible if you are unable to participate in some of the
                                tours or activities due to any physical restrictions. Please provide any relevant
                                information that may be necessary for us to create and perform the perfect program for
                                your condition, should that be necessary. </p>
                            <p>In case of any allergies or specific food needs, please notify us while tailoring your
                                program so we can arrange the food plan or propose restaurants to accommodate that. </p>
                            <h3>Assistance in case of health problems </h3>
                            <p>In case of an unforeseen health emergency or need of a doctor Seasons Tour will assist
                                you in getting in touch with the appropriate doctor or hospital as soon as possible and
                                provide transfer as needed. If there is a significant cost that derives from a case
                                where assistance is needed then we are allowed to charge an amount that is in accordance
                                with that cost. </p>

                            <h3>Personal information and privacy</h3>
                            <p>Seasons Tour respects and does not collect any personal information from our clients
                                unless it is voluntarily offered in order to better tailor your trip. All information
                                that you provide us with will solely be used to make sure that the people and suppliers
                                that are providing service to you may do so perfectly. No information is provided to any
                                third party that is not involved with your tour or services needed to complete your
                                package. </p>
                            <p>We operate under the national data protection law that controls the use and protection of
                                data. Should you submit your credit card information to Seasons Tour then it will only
                                be used in order to pay for additional services requested by you or changes of services
                                requested by you that entail more cost than originally quoted in your contract. </p>
                            <h3>Liability of Seasons Tour to clients</h3>
                            <p>We are liable to provide services as promised in our contracts and make any amends for
                                those services, should you have the right to compensation. </p>
                            <p>If you, during your stay, find that there is any lack of quality / conformity in the
                                performance of your package versus what is listed in your contract, you need to notify
                                us without any delay so that we may either offer you a solution or compensation should
                                our solutions not be acceptable. The cost of such remedy can not be disproportionate but
                                all effort will be made to provide equally good or better services instead of the
                                lacking ones. </p>
                            <p>If we are not able to perform a significant portion of your trip while you are touring
                                with us then we will offer an alternative program, given that you would accept such a
                                program. Should that program be of lower quality, an appropriate price reduction will be
                                offered. If we are unable to provide an alternative program or our substitutes are
                                unacceptable then you are entitled to a price reduction taking into account the lost
                                portion of the trip and the effect on the whole arrangement. </p>
                            <p>You are allowed to reject the alternative arrangements we offer, only if it is of lesser
                                quality then the original package.</p>
                            <p>Where lack of conformity is the result of your actions, of a third party unrelated to
                                your trip or extraordinary and unavoidable circumstances then you are not entitled to
                                compensation. </p>
                            <h3>Hotel in case of rupture of contract</h3>
                            <p>In the case where a client uses his right to terminate a contract but can by no means
                                return to his home then Seasons Tour must pay for up to three nights of accommodation of
                                similar quality for the client. </p>
                            <p>In case of pregnant women, children traveling on their own, handicapped or disabled
                                persons and their assistants, the three day restriction does not apply if Seasons Tour
                                has been informed about their condition 48 hours before start of services. </p>
                            <p>If extraordinary and unforeseeable conditions prevent you from returning home then
                                Seasons Tour is not obligated to pay for the accommodation. Those conditions could
                                include as examples acts of terror, weather, volcanic eruptions, political crises,
                                pandemics etc. </p>
                            <h3>Name changes</h3>
                            <p>You have a right to change the name on the contract with a 7 day written notice, should
                                you not be able to use your travel arrangements with us. Any additional cost that comes
                                from such a change falls on you. You and the person that will use your contract are
                                jointly responsible for the financial obligations to Seasons Tour. It is also your duty
                                to inform of any physical problems that could prevent the new party to fully enjoy and
                                participate in every aspect of all components in the contract. We try to provide minor
                                changes to meet the needs of the new party as much as possible, depending on
                                availability. The new party is STRONGLY advised to read the terms and conditions before
                                entering the contract. </p>
                            <p>In regard to name changes, Seasons Tour does not accept minors under 18 years old
                                traveling alone since in Georgia they are not able to make legally binding
                                contracts. </p>
                            <h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
                            <p>Any disputes will be resolved in the Georgia court of law. </p>
